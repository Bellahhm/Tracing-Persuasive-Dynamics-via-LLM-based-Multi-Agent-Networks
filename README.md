# Tracing-Persuasive-Dynamics-via-LLM-based-Multi-Agent-Networks
This is a repository for article "Influence in Motion: Tracing Persuasive Dynamics via LLM based Multi-Agent Networks "data and database of simulation codes.

We design a hybrid architecture consisting of (1) a cognitive–affective agent (CAA) module, which equips agents with linguistic repertoires, memory traces, and reflective capacities, and (2) an adaptive interaction simulator (AIS), which governs recruitment, discourse dynamics, and network evolution. We evaluate this framework through an exemplary simulation on topic discussion, observing how discourse-driven interactions yield polarization, influence shifts, and group formation.
