# Tracing-Persuasive-Dynamics-via-LLM-based-Multi-Agent-Networks
This repository contains the data and simulation codes for the article "Influence in Motion: Tracing Persuasive Dynamics via LLM-based Multi-Agent Networks".

This project implements a bottom-up simulation framework integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents into an agent-based modeling (ABM) environment.The architecture consists of two components:
(1) Cognitive–Affective Agent (CAA) Module：Implements language-based response generation, memory traces, and context-sensitive state updating using LLM prompts.
(2) Adaptive Interaction Simulator (AIS)：Governs interaction scheduling, discourse exchange, persuasion dynamics, and network evolution.
The framework enables the observation of how discourse-driven interactions aggregate into macro-level outcomes such as opinion clustering, influence redistribution, and structural polarization.

The experiment reported in the paper is based on an exemplary simulation run on a contested topic within a directed Watts–Strogatz network.
